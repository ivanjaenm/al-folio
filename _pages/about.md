¡Hola! :wave: I am Ivan (pronounced: ee-vahn), a second-year PhD student focusing on Optimization and Machine Learning. I'm currently supported by a [Fulbright fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org), a [CONACYT scholarship](https://conahcyt.mx/becas_posgrados/becas-al-extranjero/) and a [departamental TAship](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/funding-and-financial-aid/#teaching-assistantship).

Prior to Wisconsin, I was solving pressing industrial problems, first in the financial sector as a Quant developer then in tech as a Data Scientist.

Previously, I completed a [MS in Computer Science](https://pcc.cimat.mx/es/maestria-pcc/perfiles) at the wonderful [Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT)](https://www.cimat.mx/), advised by [Dr. Arturo Hernandez](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276145400).\
I completed my BS thesis in the CIMAT [undergraduate research thesis program](https://www.cimat.mx/oferta-educativa/tesis-de-licenciatura/) advised by Dr. Arturo Hernandez and [Dr. Rafael Rivera](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?hl=en&user=UoFV9LAAAAAJ)

Feel free to reach out! Tambien hablo Español.
