I am a computer engineer and scientist who is passionate about the interplay between mathematical theory of intelligent systems, computational algorithms and their applications to real-world problems. I have experience in both academic computer science and practical engineering.

I conducted research in combinatorial optimization working with [Dr. Rafael Rivera](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?hl=en&user=UoFV9LAAAAAJ) at TecNM-Veracruz, Mexico, evolutionary computation with [Dr. Arturo Hernandez](https://www.cimat.mx/~artha/) at [CIMAT-Guanajuato](http://pcc.cimat.mx/), Mexico and probabilistic modeling and machine learning with [Dr. John McCall](https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john) at [RGU, UK](http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/computational-intelligence-research-group/). 

Amazed to explore how basic research is transformed into technology I started my professional career working in the financial industry as a Quant developer. Currently I am a Software Engineer in tech. I am skilled in C++, Python and modern software engineering best practices.
