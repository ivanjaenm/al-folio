Hola! :wave: I am a computer scientist who is passionate about the interplay between mathematical theory of intelligent systems, computational algorithms and their applications to real-world problems. I have experience in both academic computer science and practical engineering.

I completed a MS in Computer Science at the wonderful [CIMAT](http://pcc.cimat.mx/) (Mexico) where I conducted research in stochastic optimization advised by [Dr. Arturo Hernandez](https://www.cimat.mx/~artha/). I did an internship working with [Dr. John McCall](https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/mccall-john) in probabilistic modeling for optimization and machine learning. I received my BS degree in Computer Engineering from Instituto Tecnologico de Veracruz (Mexico) advised by [Dr. Rafael Rivera](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?hl=en&user=UoFV9LAAAAAJ). I completed my BS thesis in the CIMAT [undergraduate research thesis program](https://www.cimat.mx/oferta-educativa/tesis-de-licenciatura/).

Amazed to explore how **basic research** is transformed into **technology** I started my professional career in the financial industry as a quant developer, after that, I worked at Microsoft as a data science engineer.

I'm proudly :mexico: and also interested in contribuiting to diversity and visibility efforts in STEM communities. 

Feel free to reach out!
