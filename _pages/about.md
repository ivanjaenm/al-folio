<!--- Â¡Hola, mundo! :wave: I am Ivan (pronounced: '*ee-vahn*'), -->
:wave: I am a third-year PhD student in the <a href='https://www.cs.wisc.edu/'>Computer Sciences Department</a> at the <a href='https://www.wisc.edu/'>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. My research focus is on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am honored to be supported by a [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org) and a departmental teaching assistantship. <!--- (https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/funding-and-financial-aid/#teaching-assistantship).-->

Before Wisconsin I worked full-time in industry, first in the financial sector as a Quant developer@[BBVA bank](https://www.bbva.com/en/trading-floor/) then in tech as Data Scientist@[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us).

I hold a [MS in Computer Science](https://pcc.cimat.mx/es/maestria-pcc/perfiles) from the wonderful [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/) (Center for Research in Mathematics) advised by Prof. [Arturo Hernandez](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276145400). I received a BS in Computer Engineering, completing my thesis as part of the CIMAT [undergraduate thesis program](https://www.cimat.mx/oferta-educativa/tesis-de-licenciatura/) under Profs. A. Hernandez and [R. Rivera](https://scholar.google.com.mx/citations?hl=en&user=UoFV9LAAAAAJ).

<!---
I am also passionate about contributing to efforts aimed at diversifying the CS community and making it more equitable. Throughout this journey, [different experiences](blog/2022/dei/) have shaped my leadership in pursuing this mission.
