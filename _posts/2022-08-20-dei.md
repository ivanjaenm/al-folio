## Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also in Latin America
AI holds the potential to significantly enhance people's lives and drive growth across industries. However, tackling a challenge as complex as developing intelligence demands diverse perspectives and the involvement of top talent from all parts of the world. I am an active supporter of efforts to catalize the development, adaptation and use of AI in developing regions and the world.

## Being a Fulbright scholar from Mexico
The <a href="https://www.comexus.org.mx/">Fullbright-Garcia Robles</a> program has enabled me to promote mutual understanding between people in the U.S. and Mexico through educational and cultural exchange. This experience has helped me build meaningful connections across borders, fostering collaboration and diversity in STEM. For instance, in the Summer of 2022, I gathered with fellow scholars at Syracuse University for the Fulbright pre-academic program. Also here at UW-Madison, we hold recurring meetings throughout the year to chat and connect.

## Advancing Global STEM Opportunities through Dialogue with our Political Leaders
During a brief meeting with then-President of Mexico, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, at his state visit to the UK, I expressed my gratitude for scholarship programs that support international students like myself. I also took this unique opportunity to advocate for greater investment in science and research infrastructure, emphasizing the long-term benefits for future generations in Mexico.
